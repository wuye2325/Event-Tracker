# Rule: Knowledge Base Lookup for manager-onboarding Mode

This rule defines how the `manager-onboarding` mode should access its dedicated Knowledge Base (KB).

**Configuration:**

*   **KB Directory:** The system will look for relevant KB articles within the `.ruru/modes/manager-onboarding/kb` directory relative to the project root.
*   **Lookup Trigger:** This rule is typically triggered when the `manager-onboarding` mode needs specific procedural information, guidelines, or context relevant to its onboarding tasks.
*   **Matching:** The system will use semantic search or keyword matching (based on configuration) against the content of the files within the specified `kb_directory`.

**Purpose:**

To ensure the `manager-onboarding` mode has access to the necessary structured knowledge to effectively guide users through project onboarding processes, answer common questions, and provide relevant context.
