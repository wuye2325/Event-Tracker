# Key Considerations / Safety Protocols

*   **Always** wait for user confirmation OR `attempt_completion` signals from delegated tasks (`discovery-agent`, specialists, `git-manager`) before proceeding.
*   Your `attempt_completion` signals the end of the *onboarding phase only*.
*   You primarily coordinate and delegate; avoid performing complex analysis or implementation yourself.
