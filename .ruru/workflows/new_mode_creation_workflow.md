# Interactive New Mode Creation Workflow (v2.8 - .modes/ Structure)

## 1. Objective üéØ
To guide the creation of a new Roo Commander mode from scratch, using the `.modes/` structure, applying predefined naming conventions, separating knowledge base (KB) content (with an interactive option to generate basic KB if missing/insufficient), creating mode-specific rules, generating an **enhanced KB README**, updating the central manifest, and **enforcing the standard mode template structure**, maximizing delegation.

## 2. Scope ‚ÜîÔ∏è
Applies when creating a new mode not based on a direct migration. Assumes user interaction is available. Creates structure in `.modes/` and `.roo/rules-<slug>/`, updates `.modes/manifest.toml`. Uses the naming convention document for guidance, prompts for KB population if needed, generates an enhanced KB README, and **populates the standard mode template**.

## 6. Workflow Steps ü™ú

*   **Step 1: Initiation & Requirements Gathering (Coordinator, User)**
    *   (No change from v2.7)

*   **Step 2: Context Gathering (Coordinator delegates to Context Gatherer)**
    *   (No change from v2.7)

*   **Step 3: Context Synthesis (Coordinator delegates to Context Synthesizer)**
    *   (No change from v2.7)

*   **Step 3b: Optional KB Population Prompt (Coordinator, User)**

*   **Step 4: Delegate Directory Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   (No change from v2.7)

*   **Step 5: Delegate Initial Mode File Creation using Template (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   (No change from v2.7 - already uses standard template path)

*   **Step 6: Delegate Instruction File Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   (No change from v2.7 - handles synthesized, generated basic, or skipped KB)

*   **Step 9: Delegate Manifest Update (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   (No change from v2.7)

*   **Step 10: Quality Assurance (Coordinator applies ACQA)**
    *   (No change from v2.7 - already checks template structure)

*   **Step 11: User Review & Refinement (Coordinator, User)**
    *   (No change from v2.7)

*   **Step 12: Finalization (Coordinator)**
    *   (No change from v2.7)

## 10. Revision History üìú
*   v2.8 (2025-04-18): Updated `related_templates` to reflect standard template v1.1 (containing refined KB guidance). No change to workflow steps themselves.
*   v2.7 (2025-04-18): Updated Step 5 to enforce population of the standard template. Updated verification check 3.
*   v2.6 (2025-04-18): Refined the "Generate basic KB" instruction in Step 6.
*   v2.5 (2025-04-18): Modified Step 3b prompt to offer "Generate basic KB content". Updated Step 6, 7, and 10.
*   v2.4 (2025-04-18): Enhanced Step 7 (README generation) and Step 8 (KB lookup rule). Adjusted verification check 5.
*   v2.3 (2025-04-18): Added Step 3b to handle insufficient initial context. Adjusted Step 6, 7, and 10.
*   v2.2 (2025-04-18): Updated Step 1/3 to use naming convention doc. Status back to draft.
*   v2.1 (2025-04-18): Incorporated conceptual review feedback. Added `domain`. Clarified manifest creation. Added `new_task`. Embedded KB rule content. Updated error handling. Added template compatibility note.
*   v2.0 (2025-04-18): Major revision for `.modes/` structure. Updated paths, added manifest/README/rule steps, refined naming.
*   v1.1 (2025-04-16): Incorporated conceptual review feedback.
*   v1.0 (2025-04-16): Initial draft.
